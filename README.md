# SoccerAnalytics

# Project Overview

In this project I use event data collected from top European leagues to construct an xG (expected goals) model. On top of an xG model I build a position based xT (expected threat) model. 

# Installation and Setup

Built using python version 3.10.

To install, first clone the project. Second create a python virtual environment in the same folder the repository was cloned to. Then run the terminal command pip install -r requirements.txt.

# Data
